# find-and-hit-ball
LEGO NXT Robot 

  Robot starts from a random position and starts to search a ball on pitch. If the robot encountered a wall or robot (sensing with light
sensor), moves backward randomly in terms of
length. After that, robot turns into randomly direction
like right or left side. If the robot finds a ball
(ultrasonic sensor sensing a movement) closes a grab
and catch the ball. After that, the robot moves with
ball 20 cm and open grabs, rotates 360 degree in
one's tracks and hits to ball and goes on to
searching ball.

  While turning, it provides this with wheel
strategy. For turning to right; left wheel stops and
only right wheel turns backward on the other hand
for turning to left; right wheel stops and only left
wheel turns backward.

  Third wheel is not controlled with motor
and it is for balance and turns according to direction
of wheels which are controlled by motor. This
movement of robot continues like this until it is
stopped.
